# Tweaking tools, never statisfied habit
Tweaking linux, because I want to try linux, linux is absolutely a toy for me, 
no productivity give, instead time sink into the dark hole of configuring linux.  
At the very initial, efficiently and elegant are the main reasons to have a 
taste on linux. I used to be a keyboard and command line zealot as a vim noob, 
keyboard navigation and shell command is much more efficient than moving my arm 
then clicking my mouse. The power of shell build on the ability to automate and 
script repetitive job to a reusable script. However, after using linux, I have 
found that how silly I am.

I regard me as a spirit cleanliness, once I choose a tools, I have to force 
myself with the same tools, including everything suitable or non-suitalbe. Back 
to the first few weeks I know vim, I try to do everything in vim, taking notes, 
writing or coding.

In this article, my using experience difference between CLI and GUI will be 
discussed, then the though after tweaking archlinux and vim. Finally, I will 
introduce my choises.
