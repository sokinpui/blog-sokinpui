I am So Kin Pui, currently a under graduate year 1 Computer Science and 
Engineering student in The Chinese University of Hong Kong.
 
I always spending time configure my tools from sratch. I hate myself waste time 
on build my style tools when there exist built, cleaner, better solution, 
however cannot escape from the favour of full control of my stuff.
