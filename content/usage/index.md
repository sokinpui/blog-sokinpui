# Philosophy
This blog inherite Unix philosophy, **Do one thing, and do it well**. The aims 
of this blog is to convert my idea, skills, discover and experience into text.  
Therefore unnessary decorations and functions are removed, function will only be 
added until it is desired. Although mainly due to my lazy to implement those not 
very important stuffs.

# Interation
**Comments is not supported** in this blog( may be add in the future ). First, 
no one visit my blog. Second, their is always better platform for discussion, 
comments should move to those platform for more detailed feedback instead a 
short comments here.

**Welcome to use my raw documents** for further improvement from others point of 
view. They are linked [here](link).
